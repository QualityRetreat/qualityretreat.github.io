# Polish Quality Retreat

## Welcome to  Polish Quality Retreat

Quality Retreat is a unique platform for knowledge sharing and idea exchange, focusing on the area of Quality Assurance (QA) and Software Testing. It is a retreat in the truest sense, providing a change of scenery  that stimulates fresh thinking and collaborative learning.

### What is Retreat in general?

The concept of a retreat, deeply rooted in many subcultures, particularly meditation and yoga, has found its relevance in the IT industry. Quality Retreat is an embodiment of this concept. It's a weekend getaway, a departure from our usual environments. 

We are a diverse group of professionals experienced in quality assurance and software testing. Together, we share insights, discuss pertinent topics related to our field, and tackle challenging subjects in a trusted and supportive environment.

### How does Quality Retreat work?

Our primary goal is to foster growth and mutual support within the Polish testing community. We hold annual meetings-retreats that function on the lean coffee model. This interactive structure allows for various topics to be proposed by members and voted on prior to discussion. This way, we ensure that our retreats are productive, engaging, and tailored to the needs of our small community.
